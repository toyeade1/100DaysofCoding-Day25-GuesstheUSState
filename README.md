# 100DaysofCoding-Day25-GuesstheUSState

for this program i imported the pandas and turtle library and used an image of a map of the us and created a game where the user will be given multiple chances
to guess a state and whatever state they guess will be added to the map. The goal of the game is to completely fill out the map. If they type in exit in the
prompt box then the game will exit and any states they could not guess will be added to a text file so they can study them and hopefully get better next 
time.
